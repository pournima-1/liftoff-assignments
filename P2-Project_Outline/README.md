### Overview
Closet Tracker is an organization application for closets. This application will help people keep track of what clothes they have and save time choosing clothes. Users can login and view their closets remotely, which can help with planning and shopping. Each clothing item would include information such as brand, date acquired, color, dirty/clean, type of clothing, occasion, and season, and users can create lists of items based on these features. Users can pick and pair outfits, sort clothes by type, and mark “favorites.” The application would keep track of number of times each time is worn. Users would be able to set a number of times worn for each item before it is marked “dirty”, or the user may manually mark an item dirty.
